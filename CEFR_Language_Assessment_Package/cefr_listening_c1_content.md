## Section 1: Understanding Extended Speech (Potentially Unstructured, Implied Relationships)

**Instructions:** Listen to the excerpt from a panel discussion. Choose the best answer.

**Audio Script 1.1 (Excerpt from a panel discussion on the future of work):**
Moderator: "Dr. Evans, you've written extensively on the gig economy. While it offers flexibility, many argue it lacks security and traditional employment benefits. What’s your take on navigating this evolving landscape, particularly for younger generations entering the workforce?"
Dr. Evans: "Well, it’s a complex tapestry, isn’t it? The allure of autonomy is undeniable, a powerful magnet for those disillusioned with rigid corporate structures. But this freedom, if we can call it that, often comes at a price – the erosion of the social safety net, the constant hustle for the next project. It’s not so much a straightforward trade-off as a recalibration of risk and reward. Young people, I find, are often more adaptable, more willing to embrace this fluidity, perhaps out of necessity, perhaps out of a different set of career aspirations. The critical piece, often missing from the broader discourse, is the need for new frameworks – portable benefits, lifelong learning initiatives – that can support this dynamism rather than penalize it. Simply lamenting the decline of the ‘job for life’ model is unproductive; we need to architect new support systems for a more portfolio-based career trajectory."

**Question 1.1:** What is Dr. Evans's general attitude towards the gig economy?
 A) Entirely positive, seeing only benefits.
 B) Wholly negative, focusing on its dangers.
 C) Nuanced, acknowledging its attractions while highlighting the need for new support structures. (Correct Answer)
 D) Indifferent, believing it will not last.

**Question 1.2:** What does Dr. Evans imply is a significant challenge associated with the gig economy?
 A) Lack of flexibility for workers.
 B) The erosion of social safety nets and traditional benefits. (Correct Answer)
 C) The unwillingness of younger generations to adapt.
 D) The decline in the quality of work produced.

**Question 1.3:** When Dr. Evans says, "Simply lamenting the decline of the ‘job for life’ model is unproductive," what is she suggesting?
 A) The ‘job for life’ model was inherently flawed.
 B) We should focus on creating new solutions rather than just regretting past structures. (Correct Answer)
 C) Young people do not value job security.
 D) The gig economy is a temporary phase.

## Section 2: Understanding Television Programmes and Films Without Too Much Effort (Implied Meaning, Speaker Attitude)

**Instructions:** Listen to the excerpt from a television documentary. Choose the best answer.

**Audio Script 2.1 (Excerpt from a documentary about urban wildlife):**
Narrator: "The red fox, an animal we often associate with cunning and rural landscapes, has become an increasingly common, and surprisingly bold, inhabitant of our cities. Once, a fleeting glimpse of russet fur at dusk was a rare treat. Now? They’re practically commuting alongside us, navigating not just parks and gardens, but busy streets and industrial estates. Some residents welcome these urban adventurers, marveling at their adaptability. Others, well, let’s just say the relationship is a little more…fraught, particularly when bins are raided or prized petunias uprooted. It’s a classic tale of human-wildlife interaction, played out on a concrete stage, forcing us to reconsider who, exactly, the city belongs to."

**Question 2.1:** What is the narrator’s primary observation about red foxes in cities?
 A) They are a significant danger to urban populations.
 B) They are becoming much more visible and adapted to urban environments. (Correct Answer)
 C) They are struggling to survive in cities due to lack of food.
 D) They are only found in large city parks.

**Question 2.2:** When the narrator says the relationship between some residents and foxes is "a little more…fraught," what is implied?
 A) Residents are actively trying to help the foxes.
 B) There are tensions and conflicts between some residents and the foxes. (Correct Answer)
 C) Residents are largely unaware of the foxes’ presence.
 D) The foxes are helping residents by controlling pests.

**Audio Script 2.2 (Dialogue from a film):**
Character A: (Sighs heavily, looking at a mountain of paperwork) "Another late night, I suppose. This merger is going to be the end of me."
Character B: (Cheerfully) "Oh, come on, it’s not all bad! Think of the opportunities! New markets, new challenges… besides, you thrive under pressure."
Character A: (Dryly) "Is that what they’re calling it these days? ‘Thriving’? I was aiming for ‘surviving until Friday’."

**Question 2.3:** What is Character A’s attitude towards the merger?
 A) Enthusiastic and optimistic.
 B) Overwhelmed and somewhat pessimistic. (Correct Answer)

## Section 3: Understanding Extended Speech with Unclear Structure or Implied Relationships

**Instructions:** Listen to an excerpt from a talk. Answer the questions.

**Audio Script 3.1 (Excerpt from a talk about creativity):**
"People often think creativity is this… lightning bolt. This sudden flash of inspiration that comes from nowhere. And yes, sometimes there’s an element of that, that serendipitous moment. But more often than not, certainly in my experience, it’s about the grind. It’s about showing up, day after day. It’s about the false starts, the dead ends, the countless revisions that nobody ever sees. That ‘aha!’ moment? It’s usually preceded by a whole lot of ‘ugh, not this again’. So, the romantic notion of the effortlessly brilliant artist… it’s a nice story, but it mostly just serves to make the rest of us feel inadequate. The real magic, if you want to call it that, is in the persistence, the willingness to wrestle with the material until it yields something, anything, of value."

**Question 3.1:** What is the speaker’s main point about creativity?
 A) It is primarily a result of sudden, effortless inspiration.
 B) It is more often the result of hard work and persistence than sudden inspiration. (Correct Answer)
 C) Only a few gifted individuals are truly creative.
 D) Romantic notions about artists are generally accurate.

**Question 3.2:** What does the speaker imply about the "false starts, the dead ends, the countless revisions"?
 A) They are signs that a person is not truly creative.
 B) They are an essential and common part of the creative process. (Correct Answer)
 C) They should be avoided by truly skilled artists.
 D) They are more common in scientific fields than in artistic ones.

*This is a sample set. More questions and varied audio inputs (e.g., academic lectures with less explicit structuring, nuanced discussions, debates with differing viewpoints, film/TV excerpts with idiomatic language and cultural references) will be added to reach 10-15 items for C1 Listening. The focus will be on understanding not just explicit meaning but also implication, attitude, and relationships between ideas in extended speech, strictly aligning with C1 descriptors.* 

**(Note on Audio Files):** For actual implementation, each audio script will correspond to a separate audio file (e.g., `C1_Listening_1.1.mp3`). These files are not created here but are implied by the scripts.
