## Task 1: Writing about a Familiar Topic (e.g., Hobbies, Work, Studies)

(Approx. 80-100 words)

| Criteria                     | **Achieves B1 Standard (Meets Expectations)**                                     | **Approaching B1 Standard (Needs Improvement)**                                    | **Below B1 Standard (Does Not Meet Expectations)**                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Completion & Relevance** | Addresses all parts of the prompt (e.g., describes hobby, why liked, how often). Content is relevant and developed with some simple details. | Addresses most parts of the prompt, but some aspects may be underdeveloped or less relevant. | Fails to address key parts of the prompt, or content is largely irrelevant or minimal. |
| **Coherence & Cohesion**     | Text is connected logically using simple linking words (and, but, because, so, then). Ideas may be organized into simple paragraphs if appropriate. | Attempts to connect ideas, but linking may be inconsistent or unclear at times. Organization may be weak. | Text is largely disconnected; little or no use of linking words. Poor organization.    |
| **Vocabulary Range & Accuracy** | Uses everyday vocabulary related to familiar topics adequately. Some attempt at less common words. Generally accurate. | Vocabulary is sufficient for basic expression but may be limited or repetitive. Some errors in word choice. | Vocabulary is inadequate for the task; frequent errors obscure meaning.                |
| **Grammar Range & Accuracy**   | Reasonable control of simple grammatical structures (present, past, future tenses, common conjunctions). Errors do not generally impede understanding. | Some control of simple structures, but errors are more frequent and may sometimes hinder understanding. | Lack of control over basic grammatical structures; errors frequently obscure meaning.  |
| **Length**                   | Approximately within the suggested word count.                                    | Significantly deviates from the suggested word count (too short or too long).      | Grossly inappropriate length.                                                          |

| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Completion & Content**  | Addresses all prompts (e.g., where/when, what was done, impressions/feelings). Content is relevant and describes experiences. | Addresses most prompts, but some aspects may be brief or less developed.           | Fails to address key prompts; description of experience is minimal or unclear.       |
| **Communicative Purpose**    | Effectively shares experiences and impressions with a friend.                     | Attempts to share experiences, but clarity or impact may be limited.               | Fails to effectively communicate experiences or impressions.                           |
| **Coherence & Cohesion**     | Events and ideas are linked in a clear sequence. Uses appropriate connectors for narration and description (e.g., first, then, after that, also). | Some attempt at sequencing and linking, but connections may be unclear or awkward.  | Narrative is disjointed and difficult to follow; poor use of connectors.              |
| **Vocabulary Range & Accuracy** | Uses vocabulary related to travel, places, activities, and expressing feelings/opinions. Generally accurate. | Vocabulary is adequate for simple descriptions but may lack range or precision. Some errors. | Vocabulary is insufficient to describe experiences or feelings clearly.                |
| **Grammar Range & Accuracy**   | Good control of basic tenses (past simple for narration, present for feelings). Use of adjectives/adverbs to add detail. Errors are present but meaning is clear. | Some control of tenses, but errors may be more frequent or significant.            | Poor control of grammar; errors frequently obscure the meaning of the narrative.       |
| **Appropriacy & Structure**  | Suitable informal tone for an email to a friend. Basic email conventions (greeting, body, closing) are followed. | Tone may be slightly inconsistent. Some email conventions may be missing or incorrect. | Tone is inappropriate. Lacks basic email structure.                                    |
| **Length**                   | Approximately within the suggested word count.                                    | Significantly deviates from the suggested word count.                              | Grossly inappropriate length.                                                          |

| **Coherence & Cohesion**     | Logical connection of ideas using appropriate linking words for future plans and reasons. | Some attempt to connect ideas, but linking may be weak or unclear.                 | Ideas are disconnected; little logical flow.                                           |
| **Vocabulary Range & Accuracy** | Uses vocabulary related to future plans, aspirations, and simple actions. Generally accurate. | Vocabulary is adequate but may be limited or repetitive.

Control of basic sentence structures. | Some control of future forms, but errors may be frequent or affect clarity.        | Poor control of future forms and sentence structures; meaning is often obscured.     |

**Overall B1 Writing Performance:**
*   A candidate performing at B1 level can write simple connected text on familiar topics or topics of personal interest. They can describe experiences, events, feelings, hopes, and ambitions. They can link a series of shorter, discrete simple elements into a connected, linear sequence of points. They have enough language to get by, with sufficient vocabulary to express him/herself with some circumlocutions on topics such as family, hobbies and interests, work, travel, and current events. Grammatical control is generally good, though influences from L1 may be evident and errors occur, these do not usually impede overall understanding.
