# CEFR-Aligned Language Skills Assessment Project Plan & Todo List

## I. Project Overview

**Objective:** Develop a complete CEFR-aligned language skills assessment (A1-C2) for website publication, including test structure, questions, answer keys, grading rubrics, and web-embeddable output.

**Skills to be Assessed:** Reading, Writing, Listening, Speaking (designed for written/automated implementation where possible).

## II. Detailed Todo List

### Phase 1: Project Structure and Foundational Design (Current Focus)
- [ ] **Task 1.1: Define Overall Test Structure per CEFR Level (A1-C2)**
    - [ ] Specify skills covered at each level.
    - [ ] Determine the number of questions/tasks per skill per level.
    - [ ] Outline the format of the test for each level (e.g., sections, time allocation if relevant, though not explicitly requested).
- [ ] **Task 1.2: Research & Define CEFR Descriptors for Each Skill/Level**
    - [ ] Gather specific CEFR "can-do" statements and linguistic competence descriptors for Reading (A1-C2).
    - [ ] Gather specific CEFR "can-do" statements and linguistic competence descriptors for Writing (A1-C2).
    - [ ] Gather specific CEFR "can-do" statements and linguistic competence descriptors for Listening (A1-C2) - *Integrate previous research*.
    - [ ] Gather specific CEFR "can-do" statements and linguistic competence descriptors for Speaking (A1-C2) - *Focus on aspects assessable via written/automated means, e.g., response to prompts, constructing dialogue*. 

### Phase 2: Content Creation - Reading Skills Assessment (A1-C2)
- [ ] **Task 2.1: Develop Reading Passages & Questions - Level A1** (10-15 questions + answers)
- [ ] **Task 2.2: Develop Reading Passages & Questions - Level A2** (10-15 questions + answers)
- [ ] **Task 2.3: Develop Reading Passages & Questions - Level B1** (10-15 questions + answers)
- [ ] **Task 2.4: Develop Reading Passages & Questions - Level B2** (10-15 questions + answers)
- [ ] **Task 2.5: Develop Reading Passages & Questions - Level C1** (10-15 questions + answers)
- [ ] **Task 2.6: Develop Reading Passages & Questions - Level C2** (10-15 questions + answers)
    *For each level, ensure varied question types (MCQ, fill-in-blanks, short answer where appropriate) and alignment with CEFR descriptors.* 

### Phase 3: Content Creation - Writing Skills Assessment (A1-C2)
- [ ] **Task 3.1: Develop Writing Prompts & Sample Answers/Criteria - Level A1** (e.g., simple sentences, form filling)
- [ ] **Task 3.2: Develop Writing Prompts & Sample Answers/Criteria - Level A2** (e.g., short notes, simple descriptions)
- [ ] **Task 3.3: Develop Writing Prompts & Sample Answers/Criteria - Level B1** (e.g., simple connected text, personal letters)
- [ ] **Task 3.4: Develop Writing Prompts & Sample Answers/Criteria - Level B2** (e.g., clear, detailed text on various subjects, essays)
- [ ] **Task 3.5: Develop Writing Prompts & Sample Answers/Criteria - Level C1** (e.g., well-structured text on complex subjects, reports)
- [ ] **Task 3.6: Develop Writing Prompts & Sample Answers/Criteria - Level C2** (e.g., complex, nuanced texts, summaries of demanding texts)
    *For each level, provide 10-15 question equivalents (prompts) and develop simple grading criteria/band descriptors.* 

### Phase 4: Content Creation - Listening Skills Assessment (A1-C2)
- [ ] **Task 4.1: Develop Listening Stimuli (Audio/Video) & Questions - Level A1** (10-15 questions + answers) - *Leverage previous research/design*
- [ ] **Task 4.2: Develop Listening Stimuli (Audio/Video) & Questions - Level A2** (10-15 questions + answers)
- [ ] **Task 4.3: Develop Listening Stimuli (Audio/Video) & Questions - Level B1** (10-15 questions + answers)
- [ ] **Task 4.4: Develop Listening Stimuli (Audio/Video) & Questions - Level B2** (10-15 questions + answers)
- [ ] **Task 4.5: Develop Listening Stimuli (Audio/Video) & Questions - Level C1** (10-15 questions + answers)
- [ ] **Task 4.6: Develop Listening Stimuli (Audio/Video) & Questions - Level C2** (10-15 questions + answers)
    *For each level, ensure varied question types (MCQ primarily) and alignment with CEFR descriptors.* 

### Phase 5: Content Creation - Speaking Skills Assessment (A1-C2 - for written/automated implementation)
- [ ] **Task 5.1: Develop Speaking Prompts & Sample Responses/Criteria - Level A1** (e.g., respond to simple questions, introduce self)
- [ ] **Task 5.2: Develop Speaking Prompts & Sample Responses/Criteria - Level A2** (e.g., simple exchange of information, describe routine)
- [ ] **Task 5.3: Develop Speaking Prompts & Sample Responses/Criteria - Level B1** (e.g., describe experiences, give reasons/opinions)
- [ ] **Task 5.4: Develop Speaking Prompts & Sample Responses/Criteria - Level B2** (e.g., present clear descriptions, develop arguments)
- [ ] **Task 5.5: Develop Speaking Prompts & Sample Responses/Criteria - Level C1** (e.g., express ideas fluently, use language flexibly)
- [ ] **Task 5.6: Develop Speaking Prompts & Sample Responses/Criteria - Level C2** (e.g., participate effortlessly, differentiate finer shades of meaning)
    *For each level, provide 10-15 question equivalents (prompts) and develop simple grading criteria/band descriptors suitable for text-based responses or AI analysis if feasible.* 

### Phase 6: Answer Keys and Grading Rubrics Compilation
- [ ] **Task 6.1: Compile Correct Answers for all MCQ/Fill-in-the-blank questions (Reading & Listening).**
- [ ] **Task 6.2: Finalize Simple Grading Criteria/Band Descriptors for Writing tasks (all levels).**
- [ ] **Task 6.3: Finalize Simple Grading Criteria/Band Descriptors for Speaking tasks (all levels).**

### Phase 7: Web Embedding Format and Instructions
- [ ] **Task 7.1: Structure Test Content (Questions, Answers, Rubrics) into HTML-ready code blocks or JSON.**
    - [ ] Decide on a consistent format (HTML or JSON, or both if feasible).
    - [ ] Implement for A1 content.
    - [ ] Implement for A2 content.
    - [ ] Implement for B1 content.
    - [ ] Implement for B2 content.
    - [ ] Implement for C1 content.
    - [ ] Implement for C2 content.
- [ ] **Task 7.2: Prepare Instructions for Embedding on WordPress or HTML5 site.**

### Phase 8: Suggest Hosting/Scoring Tool (Bonus)
- [ ] **Task 8.1: Research and suggest 1-2 free or low-code tools for hosting/scoring (e.g., Typeform, Google Forms, JS library).**

### Phase 9: Validation and Final Review
- [ ] **Task 9.1: Review all content for CEFR alignment, accuracy, and completeness.**
- [ ] **Task 9.2: Verify all answer keys and grading rubrics.**
- [ ] **Task 9.3: Test web-embeddable output (if possible, conceptually).**

### Phase 10: Reporting and Delivery
- [ ] **Task 10.1: Compile all deliverables into a final package.**
- [ ] **Task 10.2: Send the complete CEFR assessment package to the user.**
