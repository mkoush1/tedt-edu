Errors in grammar and spelling are expected but should not prevent understanding of the core message.\n*   Holistic assessment is often appropriate, looking at whether the candidate can convey very simple information.\n\n---\n\n## Task 1: Filling in a Simple Form (e.g., Language School Registration)\n\n| Criteria                     | **Achieves A1 Standard (Meets Expectations)**                                  | **Approaching A1 Standard (Needs Improvement)**                                 | **Below A1 Standard (Does Not Meet Expectations)**                                  |\n| :--------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Task Completion**          | Attempts all or most relevant fields with appropriate information.             | Attempts some fields, but several may be missing or inappropriately filled.     | Very few fields attempted, or information is largely irrelevant/incomprehensible. |\n| **Accuracy of Personal Info**| Information provided is plausible and generally correctly formatted (e.g., name, date). | Some inaccuracies or formatting errors in personal details.                     | Information is largely inaccurate or incorrectly formatted.                       |\n| **Legibility/Clarity**       | Handwriting/typed text is clear enough to be understood without undue effort.  | Handwriting/typed text may be difficult to read in places.                      | Handwriting/typed text is largely illegible.                                      |\n| **Basic Spelling**           | Very common words (name, nationality, numbers) are spelled recognizably.       | Frequent spelling errors, even in very common words, may hinder understanding.  | Spelling makes the information very difficult or impossible to understand.        |\n\n---\n\n## Task 2: Writing a Short, Simple Postcard (e.g., Holiday Greetings)\n\n(Approx. 20-30 words)\n\n| Criteria                     | **Achieves A1 Standard (Meets Expectations)**                                     | **Approaching A1 Standard (Needs Improvement)**                                    | **Below A1 Standard (Does Not Meet Expectations)**                                     |\n| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Task Completion**          | Addresses the prompt (e.g., says where they are, one thing they like).            | Partially addresses the prompt; key information may be missing.                    | Does not address the prompt or message is irrelevant.                                  |\n| **Communicative Purpose**    | Message is understandable as a simple greeting/update.                            | Message is somewhat unclear or its purpose is difficult to discern.                | Message is incomprehensible or fails to communicate any greeting/update.               |\n| **Vocabulary**               | Uses very simple, familiar words related to the topic (holidays, places, likes).  | Limited vocabulary; may struggle to find appropriate words.                        | Vocabulary is inadequate for the task; meaning is obscured.                            |\n| **Grammar & Structure**      | Uses very basic sentence structures (e.g., \"I am in [place]. I like [thing].\").   | Attempts simple sentences but with frequent errors that may obscure meaning.       | Lacks basic sentence structure; largely a list of words or incomprehensible phrases. |\n| **Length & Appropriacy**     | Approximately within suggested word count. Basic postcard conventions (greeting/closing if prompted) are attempted. | Significantly too short/long. Conventions may be missing.                          | Grossly inappropriate length or no attempt at conventions.                             |\n\n---\n\n## Task 3: Writing Simple Sentences about Oneself\n\n(e.g., 3 simple sentences)\n\n| Criteria                     | **Achieves A1 Standard (Meets Expectations)**                                     | **Approaching A1 Standard (Needs Improvement)**                                    | **Below A1 Standard (Does Not Meet Expectations)**                                     |\n| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Task Completion**          | Produces the required number of simple sentences relevant to the prompt.          | Produces fewer sentences than required, or some sentences are off-topic.           | Fails to produce recognizable sentences or sentences are entirely irrelevant.          |\n| **Relevance**                | Sentences are clearly about the writer (name, location, likes, etc.).             | Some sentences may not be clearly about the writer or are ambiguous.               | Sentences are not about the writer or are incomprehensible.                            |\n| **Vocabulary**               | Uses basic personal information vocabulary correctly.                             | Limited vocabulary; may use incorrect words for basic concepts.                    | Vocabulary is inadequate to convey personal information.                               |\n| **Grammar & Structure**      | Forms very simple, recognizable sentences (Subject-Verb-Object).                  | Attempts simple sentences but with significant structural errors obscuring meaning.  | Unable to form basic sentence structures; meaning is lost.                             |\n\n---\n\n**Overall A1 Writing Performance:**\n*   A candidate performing at A1 level will generally meet the expectations in most criteria across the tasks. They can convey very basic information in writing using simple, isolated phrases and sentences. While errors are frequent, the core message is usually understandable, especially with familiar, concrete topics.\n\n"

What seems novel is the speed and scale facilitated by digital technologies. Furthermore, the speaker focused heavily on the supply side – the purveyors of misinformation – but perhaps more attention could be given to the demand side: why are populations seemingly more receptive to these narratives?
