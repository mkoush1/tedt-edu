# CEFR B2 Speaking Assessment Content

**Based on CEFR B2 Speaking Descriptors:**
*   **Spoken Interaction:** "I can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers quite possible. I can take an active part in discussion in familiar contexts, accounting for and sustaining my views."
*   **Spoken Production:** "I can present clear, detailed descriptions on a wide range of subjects related to my field of interest. I can explain a viewpoint on a topical issue giving the advantages and disadvantages of various options."

**Number of Tasks:** 3-4 (This is an initial draft for B2 Speaking. Tasks are designed for examiner-candidate interaction or for text-based/recorded responses. Prompts will encourage fluent, spontaneous, and detailed responses.)

**General Instructions for Examiner/System:** Encourage extended turns and spontaneous interaction. Facilitate discussion by asking follow-up questions if appropriate, but allow the candidate to develop their points.

## Task 1: Discussion on a Topical Issue (Interaction & Production)

**Examiner/Prompt:** "Let's discuss the impact of social media on society. Some people believe it has greatly improved communication and connection, while others are concerned about its negative effects, like misinformation or its impact on mental health. What are your views on this? Could you explain your position, perhaps giving some advantages and disadvantages?"
**(Expected Candidate Response Type):** Extended response expressing and justifying a viewpoint, discussing advantages/disadvantages with some fluency and spontaneity. e.g., "That's an interesting question. In my opinion, social media is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it offers incredible advantages like [advantage 1 with explanation/example] and [advantage 2 with explanation/example]. However, we can't ignore the downsides. For instance, [disadvantage 1 with explanation/example] is a serious concern, and also [disadvantage 2 with explanation/example]. So, while I appreciate its benefits, I think we need to be more critical..."

**(Follow-up prompts by examiner if needed to sustain discussion):**
*   "Can you elaborate on that point?"
*   "What do you think about the role of regulation?"
*   "How has social media affected your own life or the lives of people you know?"

**(Scoring Rubric Focus for B2 Task 1):**
*   **Task Completion:** Actively participates in a discussion, accounts for and sustains views on a topical issue.
*   **Fluency and Spontaneity:** Interacts with a degree of fluency and spontaneity, making regular interaction possible. Less noticeable hesitation for planning.

*   **Interaction:** Can take an active part, initiate, and maintain discussion.

## Task 2: Presenting a Clear, Detailed Description or Explanation (Production)

**Examiner/Prompt:** "I'd like you to choose one of the following topics and talk about it for about 1-2 minutes. You can make some brief notes if you wish.

1.  Describe a technological gadget that you find particularly useful or interesting. Explain what it does, why it's useful/interesting to you, and what its potential impact could be.
2.  Explain the advantages and disadvantages of living in a big city compared to living in the countryside.
3.  Describe a skill you have learned that you are proud of. Explain how you learned it, what challenges you faced, and why it is important to you."

**(Candidate has 1 minute to prepare and make notes if desired, then speaks for 1-2 minutes.)**

**(Expected Candidate Response Type - for topic 2, for example):** A clear, detailed explanation with advantages and disadvantages. e.g., "I'd like to talk about the pros and cons of urban versus rural living. Living in a big city offers numerous advantages. Firstly, there's the convenience: public transport is usually excellent, and you have access to a vast array of shops, restaurants, and entertainment options. Secondly, career opportunities are often more plentiful and diverse... However, there are also significant drawbacks. The cost of living, particularly housing, can be exorbitant. Pollution – air and noise – is another major issue... On the other hand, the countryside offers a more peaceful environment... [continues with disadvantages of countryside, then perhaps a concluding thought]."

**(Scoring Rubric Focus for B2 Task 2):**
*   **Task Completion:** Presents a clear, detailed description or explanation on the chosen topic.
*   **Content and Development:** Ideas are well-developed with supporting details and examples.
*   **Organization:** Information is presented logically and coherently.
*   **Vocabulary Range and Precision:** Uses a range of vocabulary accurately and appropriately to discuss the topic in detail.
*   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:** Uses a variety of complex structures effectively. Good grammatical control.
*   **Fluency:** Can speak at length with a relatively even tempo. Hesitations are usually for thought rather than linguistic searching.
*   **Pronunciation:** Clear and natural pronunciation and intonation.

## Task 3: Collaborative Task / Problem Solving (Interaction)

**Examiner/Prompt:** "Imagine we are colleagues in a company. Our department has been given a small budget to organize a team-building activity. We need to decide what kind of activity to organize. Here are some ideas: a one-day outdoor adventure trip, a cooking class, or a volunteer day for a local charity. Let's discuss these options, considering things like cost, appeal to different team members, and the potential benefits for team bonding. We should try to agree on the best option."

**(Examiner participates in the discussion, presenting some views or asking clarifying questions to facilitate interaction.)**

**(Expected Candidate Response Type):** Engages in a discussion, expresses opinions, agrees/disagrees politely, makes suggestions, negotiates, and works towards a decision. e.g., "Okay, that sounds interesting. The outdoor adventure trip could be fun and good for bonding, but it might be expensive and not everyone might be physically able for it. What do you think? ... A cooking class could be more inclusive, and we could learn something new together. However, some people might not be interested in cooking... The volunteer day is a nice idea for giving back, and it could foster a different kind of teamwork. Perhaps we should consider what the main aim of the team building is..."

**(Scoring Rubric Focus for B2 Task 3):**
*   **Task Completion:** Actively participates in a discussion to solve a problem or make a decision.
*   **Interactional Strategies:** Can initiate discussion, express and ask for opinions, agree and disagree politely, make suggestions, persuade, and move towards a consensus.
*   **Fluency and Spontaneity:** Interacts with a good degree of fluency and spontaneity.
*   **Coherence:** Contributions are relevant and logically connected to the discussion.
*   **Language of Discussion:** Uses appropriate phrases for discussion, negotiation, and expressing viewpoints.
*   **Appropriacy:** Maintains an appropriate level of formality for a workplace discussion.

*This is a sample set. More tasks, or variations involving different topical issues, descriptive tasks related to fields of interest (e.g., describing a complex process, explaining a concept), and interactive problem-solving scenarios will be developed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the B2 Speaking descriptors. The focus is on fluent, spontaneous, and effective communication in a range of contexts.* 

**(Note on Implementation):** These tasks are best assessed through live interaction or recorded responses to capture the nuances of fluency, spontaneity, and interactional skills.
