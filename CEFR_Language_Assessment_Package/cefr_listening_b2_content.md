## Section 1: Understanding Extended Speech and Lectures (Reasonably Familiar Topics)

**Instructions:** Listen to the excerpt from a lecture. Choose the best answer.

**Audio Script 1.1 (Excerpt from a university lecture on climate change):**
"Good morning, everyone. Today, we delve deeper into the multifaceted impacts of climate change, moving beyond the oft-cited rising sea levels and extreme weather events. One critical area, perhaps less discussed in mainstream media but of profound ecological significance, is the impact on biodiversity. As habitats alter температурами and precipitation patterns shift, many species struggle to adapt or migrate quickly enough. This can lead to local extinctions and a disruption of entire ecosystems. For instance, consider coral reefs: even a slight, sustained increase in ocean temperature can cause widespread bleaching, devastating these vibrant underwater communities. Furthermore, the interconnectedness of species means that the loss of one can have cascading effects throughout the food web. It’s not just about saving polar bears; it’s about preserving the intricate balance that sustains life on Earth. We’ll be examining several case studies that illustrate these complex interactions..."

**Question 1.1:** What is the main focus of this part of the lecture?
 A) The economic costs of rising sea levels.
 B) The impact of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystems. (Correct Answer)
 C) The role of media in discussing climate change.

 A) They attract more diverse fish species.
 B) They experience widespread bleaching. (Correct Answer)
 C) They adapt quickly to the new temperatures.
 D) They become more resilient to pollution.

**Question 1.3:** What does the lecturer mean by "cascading effects throughout the food web"?
 A) That all species will eventually become extinct.
 B) That the loss of one species can negatively impact many other connected species. (Correct Answer)
 C) That food webs become stronger and more resilient.
 D) That new food sources will emerge due to climate change.

## Section 3: Understanding the Majority of Films in Standard Dialect (Dialogue Excerpt)

**Instructions:** Listen to the dialogue excerpt from a film. Choose the best answer.

**Audio Script 3.1 (Dialogue between two characters discussing a plan):**
Character A: "So, are we all agreed? We move at dawn. Sarah, you’ll handle disabling the security system. Mark, you’re on distraction – make sure their attention is elsewhere. I’ll go for the main objective."
Character B (Sarah): "Disabling their system won’t be easy. It’s state-of-the-art. I’ll need at least an hour, and complete silence."
Character C (Mark): "Distraction? What kind of distraction are we talking about? Something subtle, or a full-blown fireworks display?"
Character A: "Subtle, Mark, subtle. We don’t want to bring the whole city down on us. Just enough to draw their primary security team away from the east wing for, say, fifteen minutes."
Character B (Sarah): "Fifteen minutes... that’s tight, but doable if Mark plays his part perfectly."

## Section 4: Following Complex Lines of Argument

**Instructions:** Listen to an excerpt from a discussion. What is the speaker’s main argument?

**Audio Script 4.1 (Excerpt from a debate about online learning):**
"While the convenience and accessibility of online learning are undeniable, and have certainly democratized education to an extent, we must critically examine its effectiveness in fostering deep conceptual understanding and essential soft skills. The argument isn’t whether online resources are valuable – they clearly are – but whether a predominantly online model can truly replicate the holistic benefits of in-person interaction, spontaneous debate, and the nuanced mentorship that often thrives in a traditional classroom setting. Over-reliance on virtual platforms risks creating a transactional educational experience, where knowledge acquisition is prioritized over the development of critical thinking and collaborative abilities. Therefore, a blended approach, strategically integrating online tools while preserving the core strengths of face-to-face learning, seems the most prudent path forward."

**Question 4.1:** What is the speaker’s main argument regarding online learning?
 A) Online learning is superior to traditional learning in all aspects.
 B) Online learning has no significant benefits and should be avoided.
 C) While online learning offers advantages, a blended approach is best to ensure deep understanding and skill development. (Correct Answer)
 D) The primary benefit of online learning is its low cost.

*This is a sample set. More questions and varied audio inputs (e.g., longer news segments, more complex lectures on familiar academic or professional topics, extended film dialogues with standard accents) will be added to reach 10-15 items for B2 Listening. The focus will be on understanding main ideas, specific information, and complex lines of argument in extended speech, strictly aligning with B2 descriptors.* 

**(Note on Audio Files):** For actual implementation, each audio script will correspond to a separate audio file (e.g., `B2_Listening_1.1.mp3`). These files are not created here but are implied by the scripts.
