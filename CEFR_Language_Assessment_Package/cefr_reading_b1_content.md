Dear Sarah,

I just got back from my holiday in Italy, and it was absolutely wonderful! We spent a week in a small village in Tuscany. The weather was perfect – sunny every day, but not too hot. We visited Florence for a day, which was amazing, though very crowded. I loved the art and the architecture. The food everywhere was delicious, especially the pasta.

Lots of love,

**Instructions:** Read the article excerpt about recycling and answer the questions.

**Article Excerpt: Why Recycling Matters**

Recycling is an important way to help our environment. When we recycle items like paper, plastic, and glass, we reduce the amount of waste that goes into landfills. Landfills can pollute the soil and water. Recycling also saves energy because making new products from recycled materials often uses less energy than making them from raw materials. For example, recycling aluminum cans uses 95% less energy than making them from scratch. Many communities have recycling programs that make it easy for people to separate their recyclable waste. By participating in these programs, everyone can make a difference.
