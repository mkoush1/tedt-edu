# CEFR B1 Speaking Assessment Content

**Based on CEFR B1 Speaking Descriptors:**
*   **Spoken Interaction:** "I can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken. I can enter unprepared into conversation on topics that are familiar, of personal interest or pertinent to everyday life (e.g. family, hobbies, work, travel and current events)."
*   **Spoken Production:** "I can connect phrases in a simple way in order to describe experiences and events, my dreams, hopes and ambitions. I can briefly give reasons and explanations for opinions and plans. I can narrate a story or relate the plot of a book or film and describe my reactions."

**Number of Tasks:** 3-4 (This is an initial draft for B1 Speaking. Tasks are designed for examiner-candidate interaction or for text-based/recorded responses. Prompts will encourage connected speech and personal expression.)

**General Instructions for Examiner/System:** Encourage the candidate to speak at some length. Provide prompts to help them develop their ideas if necessary, but allow them to lead the conversation on familiar topics.

*This is a sample set. More tasks, or variations involving different familiar topics (e.g., discussing work/studies, opinions on social issues, describing cultural events) and interactive scenarios will be developed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the B1 Speaking descriptors. The focus is on maintaining interaction, expressing oneself on a range of personal and familiar topics, and narrating/describing with connected discourse.* 

**(Note on Implementation):** These tasks are best suited for live interaction or recorded responses. Text-based adaptations would assess the content and structure but not the interactive or phonological aspects.
