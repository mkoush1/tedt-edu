# CEFR A1 Speaking Assessment - Grading Rubric

**Based on CEFR A1 Speaking Descriptors:**
*   **Spoken Interaction:** "I can interact in a simple way provided the other person is prepared to repeat or rephrase things at a slower rate of speech and help me formulate what I'm trying to say. I can ask and answer simple questions in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics."
*   **Spoken Production:** "I can use simple phrases and sentences to describe where I live and people I know."

**General Notes for Grading A1 Speaking:**
*   Focus is on basic communicative effectiveness in very familiar situations. Speech is expected to be slow, with frequent pauses and reliance on the interlocutor.
*   Pronunciation errors are common but should not prevent understanding of very basic utterances.
*   Holistic assessment is often appropriate, looking at whether the candidate can convey very simple information and engage in basic interaction with support.
