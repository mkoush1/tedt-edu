## Task 1: Writing an Essay on a Complex Subject (e.g., societal impact of AI)

(Approx. 220-260 words)

| Criteria                        | **Achieves C1 Standard (Meets Expectations)**                                     | **Approaching C1 Standard (Needs Improvement)**                                    | **Below C1 Standard (Does Not Meet Expectations)**                                     |
| :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Completion & Content Depth** | Comprehensively addresses all aspects of the prompt, exploring complex issues with depth and insight. Salient issues are clearly underlined. | Addresses most aspects of the prompt, but depth of exploration or focus on salient issues may be limited. | Fails to address key aspects of the prompt; discussion of complex issues is superficial or unclear. |
| **Coherence & Cohesion**        | Essay is logically structured with well-defined paragraphs and effective, sophisticated transitions. Complex ideas are linked fluently and clearly. | Essay has a clear structure, but transitions or linking of complex ideas may sometimes be less smooth or effective. | Essay lacks clear logical structure; organization is weak, and connections between ideas are often unclear. |
| **Vocabulary Range & Precision**  | Uses a wide range of sophisticated vocabulary, including idiomatic expressions and nuanced language appropriate for discussing complex subjects. High degree of lexical accuracy. | Uses a good range of vocabulary, but may lack the precision or sophistication expected at C1. Some errors in word choice or idiom. | Vocabulary is limited for discussing complex subjects, or frequent errors obscure meaning. |
| **Grammar Range & Accuracy**      | Confident and flexible use of a wide range of complex grammatical structures. Errors are rare and do not impede communication; often self-corrected if they occur. | Uses a range of complex structures, but control may be inconsistent, or errors may occasionally cause slight confusion. | Limited range of complex structures, or frequent errors significantly impede understanding. |
| **Argumentation & Critical Thinking** | Arguments are well-developed, persuasive, and supported by relevant points or examples. Evidence of critical thinking and ability to synthesize information. | Arguments are generally clear and supported, but may lack depth, persuasiveness, or consistent critical insight. | Arguments are weak, poorly developed, or lack support. Little evidence of critical thinking. |
| **Style & Register**            | Consistent and appropriate academic or formal register. Ability to adapt style effectively to convey complex ideas and engage the reader. | Register is generally appropriate, but there may be minor inconsistencies or less effective stylistic choices. | Register is inappropriate for the task; style is not well-adapted for conveying complex ideas. |
| **Length**                      | Approximately within the suggested word count.                                    | Significantly deviates from the suggested word count.                              | Grossly inappropriate length.                                                          |
