# CEFR A2 Speaking Assessment - Grading Rubric

**Based on CEFR A2 Speaking Descriptors:**
*   **Spoken Interaction:** "I can interact in simple, routine tasks requiring a simple and direct exchange of information on familiar topics and activities. I can handle very short social exchanges, even though I canâ€™t usually understand enough to keep the conversation going myself."
*   **Spoken Production:** "I can use a series of phrases and sentences to describe in simple terms my family and other people, living conditions, my educational background and my present or most recent job."

**General Notes for Grading A2 Speaking:**
*   Focus is on the ability to participate in short social exchanges and describe familiar topics in simple terms. Speech may still be hesitant, but with more connected phrases than at A1.
*   Pronunciation is generally intelligible, though L1 influence may be strong. Grammatical accuracy is developing for basic structures.

| **Grammar & Structure**      | Uses simple learned phrases and basic sentence structures (e.g., "I like [X]." "How are you?"). Some control of present simple. | Attempts simple sentences but with frequent errors that may hinder understanding.  | Lacks control of basic sentence structures; utterances are often incomprehensible.    |
| **Pronunciation & Fluency**  | Pronunciation is generally intelligible, though L1 influence may be evident. Speech may be hesitant but includes short connected phrases. | Pronunciation makes understanding difficult at times. Speech is very hesitant and fragmented. | Pronunciation is largely unintelligible. Very little connected speech.                 |
| **Interaction**              | Can handle very short social exchanges. Can ask and answer simple questions on familiar topics. May need some prompting. | Interaction is limited; struggles to maintain even short exchanges without significant support. | Unable to sustain basic interaction, even with prompting.                              |

## Task 2: Exchanging Information (Interaction)

| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Completion**          | Can ask for and provide simple, factual information on familiar topics (e.g., "What time is it?" "It is 5 euros."). | Attempts to exchange information but may struggle with accuracy or clarity.        | Unable to ask for or provide simple factual information effectively.                   |
| **Comprehension & Response** | Understands simple, direct questions and requests for information. Responds appropriately. | May misunderstand or need frequent repetition. Responses may be unclear or inappropriate. | Understands very little; responses are generally irrelevant or incomprehensible.       |
| **Vocabulary & Grammar**     | Uses vocabulary related to numbers, time, prices, common objects, and activities. Basic question forms and statements. | Limited vocabulary for these functions. Grammatical errors may obscure meaning.    | Vocabulary and grammar are inadequate for exchanging simple information.               |
| **Interactional Fluency**    | Can participate in simple, routine exchanges with some prompting.                 | Relies heavily on prompting; interaction is very slow and difficult.               | Fails to engage in information exchange.                                               |
