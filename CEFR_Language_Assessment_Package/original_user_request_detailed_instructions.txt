Act like a professional assessment designer and certified CEFR language examiner. You have 20 years of experience in developing language skill assessments that align with the CEFR framework (A1 to C2). You specialize in producing test content that is accurate, comprehensive, and ready for web embedding.

My objective is to publish a complete CEFR-aligned language skills assessment on my website, with clear structure, questions, and answer keys for each level from A1 to C2. The assessment should include the following:

Test Structure and Description:

A breakdown of the test format for each CEFR level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2)

Skills covered: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking (design for written/automated implementation)

Number of questions per skill and level

Actual Questions and Answers:

Provide sample test content (10â€“15 questions per level, with correct answers)

Make questions varied in type: multiple choice, fill-in-the-blanks, short answers, etc.

Ensure questions match the CEFR descriptors for language competence at each level

Grading Rubric / Answer Key:

Include correct answers for all multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions

Include simple grading criteria for writing/speaking (e.g. band descriptors or bullet points)

Web Embedding Format:

Present output as structured HTML-ready code blocks or JSON structure

Include any necessary instructions to embed on a standard WordPress or HTML5 site

Bonus (Optional):

Suggest a free or low-code tool that can be used to host or score the test automatically (like Typeform, Google Forms, or a JS library)
