# CEFR-Aligned Language Assessment: Framework and Design Principles

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the foundational structure and design principles for the comprehensive CEFR-aligned language skills assessment, covering levels A1 through C2. It serves as a blueprint for the development of test content for Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking skills. The primary goal is to create an assessment that is accurate, comprehensive, aligned with CEFR descriptors, and ready for web embedding.

## 2. Overall Test Structure per CEFR Level

For each CEFR level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2), the assessment will cover four core language skills: Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking. The speaking component will be designed for written or automated implementation (e.g., text-based responses to prompts, simulated dialogues).

**General Parameters per Level & Skill:**
*   **Number of Questions/Tasks:** Approximately 10-15 questions or task equivalents per skill, per level.
*   **Question Types:** A variety of question types will be employed, including multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blanks, short answers, matching, and task-based prompts (especially for Writing and Speaking).
*   **Alignment:** All content will be meticulously aligned with the specific CEFR "can-do" statements and linguistic competence descriptors for the target level and skill.

### 2.1. Level A1 (Beginner)
*   **Reading:** Focus on understanding very short, simple texts, familiar names, words, and basic phrases. Questions will test recognition and basic comprehension.
    *   *Format:* Short passages, signs, simple notices. MCQs, matching single words/phrases.
*   **Writing:** Focus on writing simple isolated phrases and sentences, filling in forms with personal details.
    *   *Format:* Form-filling, writing simple sentences about oneself or familiar topics.
*   **Listening:** Focus on understanding familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type, when spoken slowly and clearly.
    *   *Format:* Short, slow audio clips (dialogues, announcements). MCQs on main points/details.
*   **Speaking (Written/Automated):** Focus on interacting in a simple way provided the other person is prepared to repeat or rephrase things at a slower rate of speech and help formulate what they are trying to say. Can ask and answer simple questions in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics.
    *   *Format:* Simple question-answer prompts (text-based), providing basic personal information.

### 2.2. Level A2 (Elementary)

If they do have a problem, can backtrack and restructure around the difficulty so smoothly that other people are hardly aware of it.
    *   *Format:* Prompts requiring highly articulate and precise responses, demonstrating mastery of idiomatic language and the ability to handle complex communicative tasks with ease.

## 3. CEFR Descriptors and Content Alignment

A core activity in this project is the systematic gathering and application of CEFR "can-do" statements and detailed linguistic competence descriptors for each skill at each level (A1-C2). This will ensure that all test content (passages, prompts, questions, and expected answers) directly reflects the abilities defined by the CEFR framework.

*   **Reading Descriptors:** Will be sourced from official CEFR documentation to guide passage selection/creation and question design.
*   **Writing Descriptors:** Will inform prompt design and the development of grading rubrics/band descriptors.
*   **Listening Descriptors:** The previous research conducted for listening skills will be integrated and expanded to cover all CEFR levels. This includes best practices for audio/video stimuli and question design.
*   **Speaking Descriptors:** Will guide the creation of prompts that elicit responses assessable through written text or potentially automated means, focusing on communicative functions, fluency (in text), coherence, and grammatical/lexical range appropriate for each level.

This framework will be expanded and refined as the project progresses. The next phase will involve detailed content creation for each skill and level, guided by these structural principles and CEFR alignment.
