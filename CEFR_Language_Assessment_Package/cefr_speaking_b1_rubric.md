# CEFR B1 Speaking Assessment - Grading Rubric

**Based on CEFR B1 Speaking Descriptors:**
*   **Spoken Interaction:** "I can deal with most situations likely to arise whilst travelling in an area where the language is spoken. I can enter unprepared into conversation on topics that are familiar, of personal interest or pertinent to everyday life (e.g. family, hobbies, work, travel and current events)."
*   **Spoken Production:** "I can connect phrases in a simple way in order to describe experiences and events, my dreams, hopes and ambitions. I can briefly give reasons and explanations for opinions and plans. I can narrate a story or relate the plot of a book or film and describe my reactions."

**General Notes for Grading B1 Speaking:**
*   Focus is on the ability to maintain interaction on familiar topics and describe experiences with some fluency. Speech is generally intelligible, though L1 influence and some hesitation for planning are expected.
*   Control of everyday vocabulary and basic grammatical structures is generally good. Can link ideas into connected discourse.
