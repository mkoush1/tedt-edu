# CEFR A2 Speaking Assessment Content

**Based on CEFR A2 Speaking Descriptors:**

*   **Spoken Production:** "I can use a series of phrases and sentences to describe in simple terms my family and other people, living conditions, my educational background and my present or most recent job."

**Number of Tasks:** 3-4 (This is an initial draft for A2 Speaking. Tasks are designed for examiner-candidate interaction or for text-based/recorded responses. Prompts will be clear and focus on familiar topics.)

**General Instructions for Examiner/System:** Speak clearly. Allow for some hesitation. Rephrase if necessary, but encourage independent production.

*This is a sample set. More tasks, or variations involving different familiar topics (e.g., describing a typical school/work day, talking about food preferences, simple directions) and routine interactions will be developed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the A2 Speaking descriptors. The focus is on direct exchange of information and simple descriptions.* 

**(Note on Implementation):** These tasks are best suited for live interaction or recorded responses to allow for assessment of pronunciation and fluency. Text-based adaptations would focus on the content and structure of the responses.
