# CEFR C2 Speaking Assessment Content

**Based on CEFR C2 Speaking Descriptors:**
*   **Spoken Interaction:** "I can take part effortlessly in any conversation or discussion and have a good familiarity with idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms. I can express myself fluently and convey finer shades of meaning precisely. If I do have a problem I can backtrack and restructure around the difficulty so smoothly that other people are hardly aware of it."
*   **Spoken Production:** "I can present a clear, smoothly-flowing description or argument in a style appropriate to the context and with an effective logical structure which helps the recipient to notice and remember significant points."

**Number of Tasks:** 3-4 (This is an initial draft for C2 Speaking. Tasks are designed for examiner-candidate interaction or for text-based/recorded responses. Prompts will demand a high level of fluency, precision, idiomatic language, and sophisticated argumentation.)

**General Instructions for Examiner/System:** Engage in natural, fast-paced conversation. Use idiomatic language. Challenge the candidate with complex or abstract ideas and expect them to navigate these with ease and precision.

## Task 1: In-depth Discussion on an Abstract or Controversial Topic (Interaction & Production)

**Examiner/Prompt:** "Let’s explore a complex societal issue: the balance between individual liberty and collective security, particularly in the context of digital surveillance and data privacy. Some argue that in an era of heightened global threats, a degree of surveillance is a necessary evil to protect the populace. Others contend that this leads to an unacceptable erosion of fundamental human rights. Where do you stand on this intricate issue, and how do you believe societies should navigate this tension? Please articulate your position with nuance, considering various perspectives and potential ramifications."

**(Expected Candidate Response Type):** A highly fluent, articulate, and well-reasoned response, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of the topic, using precise language and idiomatic expressions, and structuring the argument effectively. e.g., "This is an exceptionally thorny issue, one that strikes at the very heart of democratic principles. My considered view is that while the state has a legitimate role in ensuring security, this must not come at the expense of a wholesale evisceration of privacy rights, which are, after all, a cornerstone of individual autonomy. The argument for surveillance often hinges on a utilitarian calculus, but this can be a slippery slope... For instance, the potential for misuse of vast datasets, the chilling effect on free expression... these are not trivial concerns. Navigating this requires, I believe, robust independent oversight, stringent legal frameworks that err on the side of privacy, and a continuous public debate to ensure that any encroachments on liberty are proportionate, necessary, and subject to democratic accountability. It’s not a binary choice, but a constant, delicate recalibration..."

**(Follow-up prompts by examiner to probe deeper):**
*   "You mentioned the ‘chilling effect.’ Could you expand on how pervasive surveillance might impact societal discourse or innovation?"
*   "What role, if any, do you think technological solutions, like end-to-end encryption or anonymization techniques, can play in mitigating these tensions?"
*   "Considering historical precedents, are there lessons we can draw about the long-term consequences of prioritizing state security over individual freedoms?"

**(Scoring Rubric Focus for C2 Task 1):**
*   **Task Completion:** Engages effortlessly and in-depth in a discussion on an abstract/controversial topic, expressing ideas with precision and sophistication.
*   **Fluency and Spontaneity:** Expresses self fluently, spontaneously, and with idiomaticity. Can backtrack and restructure smoothly if needed.
*   **Coherence and Cohesion:** Presents a clear, smoothly-flowing, and effectively structured argument. Uses a wide range of cohesive devices with mastery.
*   **Vocabulary Range and Precision:** Demonstrates a rich and precise lexical repertoire, including idiomatic expressions, colloquialisms, and the ability to convey finer shades of meaning.
*   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:** Consistently maintains a high degree of grammatical accuracy with a full operational command of complex grammatical structures. Errors are negligible.
*   **Interaction:** Takes an active and effortless part in the discussion, relating contributions skilfully and often leading the direction of the conversation.

## Task 2: Impromptu Presentation and Defence of a Complex Argument (Production & Interaction)

**Examiner/Prompt:** "I’m going to give you a statement on a complex issue. You will have 2 minutes to prepare a short (2-3 minute) impromptu response where you either strongly agree or strongly disagree with the statement, providing a well-structured argument with supporting points. After your response, I will challenge your position.

**Statement:** *‘The pursuit of perpetual economic growth is fundamentally incompatible with long-term environmental sustainability.’*"

**(Candidate has 2 minutes to prepare, then delivers a 2-3 minute response.)**

**(Expected Candidate Response Type - e.g., agreeing):** A clear, smoothly-flowing, and persuasive argument. e.g., "I find myself in strong agreement with the assertion that the relentless pursuit of perpetual economic growth, as traditionally defined, is indeed on a collision course with long-term environmental sustainability. The prevailing economic paradigm, predicated on ever-increasing consumption and resource exploitation, inherently strains planetary boundaries... We see this manifested in climate change, biodiversity loss, resource depletion... While proponents of ‘green growth’ or technological decoupling offer some hope, the empirical evidence for a sufficient and timely decoupling at a global scale remains tenuous at best... Therefore, a fundamental rethinking of our economic objectives, perhaps shifting focus towards qualitative development, circular economies, and steady-state models, seems not merely advisable but existentially necessary..."

**(Examiner then challenges the candidate’s position, e.g., "But isn’t economic growth essential for poverty reduction and funding the very green technologies you allude to? How can we achieve sustainability without the innovation and resources that growth provides?")**

**(Candidate responds to the challenge, defending or refining their position.)**

**(Scoring Rubric Focus for C2 Task 2):**
*   **Task Completion:** Presents a clear, smoothly-flowing, and well-structured argument on a complex statement and effectively defends their position against challenges.
*   **Argumentation and Logic:** Develops a cogent and persuasive argument with effective logical structuring. Significant points are highlighted and memorable.
*   **Fluency and Precision:** Speaks fluently, precisely, and with appropriate style for presenting and defending an argument.
*   **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Uses a wide and precise range of vocabulary and complex grammatical structures with mastery.
*   **Handling Challenges (Interaction):** Responds to challenges thoughtfully and articulately, defending or adapting their position skilfully.

## Task 3: Summarizing and Critiquing an Extended Piece of Discourse (e.g., a Lecture Excerpt, a Recorded Debate Segment) (Production & Interaction)

**Examiner/Prompt:** "You are going to listen to a short (approx. 2-3 minutes) audio excerpt from an academic lecture discussing the concept of ‘post-truth’ in contemporary media. Listen carefully. Afterwards, I would like you to first summarize the main arguments presented by the speaker, and then offer your own brief critique or perspective on those arguments."

**(Plays audio excerpt - a C1/C2 level academic discussion on ‘post-truth’, its characteristics, causes, and implications.)**

**(Expected Candidate Response Type - Summary & Critique):**
Summary: "The speaker essentially argued that the ‘post-truth’ phenomenon is characterized by a political and media landscape where objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief. They identified several contributing factors, including the fragmentation of media, the rise of social media echo chambers, and a general decline in trust in traditional institutions. The implications, as outlined, are quite severe, potentially undermining rational discourse and democratic processes..."
Critique: "While I largely concur with the speaker’s diagnosis, I think one could perhaps also explore the historical antecedents more deeply; propaganda and the manipulation of information are hardly new. What seems novel is the speed and scale facilitated by digital technologies. Furthermore, the speaker focused heavily on the supply side – the purveyors of misinformation – but perhaps more attention could be given to the demand side: why are populations seemingly more receptive to these narratives? Is it a symptom of broader societal anxieties or educational deficits?..."

**(Examiner may ask follow-up questions based on the critique.)**

**(Scoring Rubric Focus for C2 Task 3):**
*   **Task Completion:** Accurately summarizes the main points of complex discourse and offers a reasoned, insightful critique.
*   **Comprehension of Complex Discourse:** Demonstrates a thorough understanding of extended, complex speech, including nuances and implied meanings.
*   **Summarizing Skills:** Can concisely and accurately convey the essence of complex arguments.
*   **Critical Thinking and Analysis:** Offers a thoughtful and well-supported critique, demonstrating analytical depth.
*   **Clarity and Structure:** Presents the summary and critique in a clear, organized, and smoothly-flowing manner.
*   **Language Proficiency:** Demonstrates mastery of vocabulary and grammar appropriate for academic discussion and critique.

*This is a sample set. More tasks, or variations involving different abstract/complex topics, professional or academic scenarios (e.g., mediating a complex dispute, delivering a nuanced policy briefing, critically analyzing literary or philosophical texts in spoken form) will be developed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the C2 Speaking descriptors. The focus is on demonstrating effortless, precise, fluent, and stylistically sophisticated communication in any context.* 

**(Note on Implementation):** These tasks necessitate live interaction or very high-fidelity recorded responses to accurately assess the full spectrum of C2 speaking abilities, including interactional nuances and the ability to handle complex, unpredictable discourse.
