## Task 1: Writing a Complex Essay or Article (Presenting a Case, e.g., on a nuanced socio-political issue)

(Approx. 250-300 words)

| Criteria                                  | **Achieves C2 Standard (Meets Expectations)**                                     | **Approaching C2 Standard (Needs Improvement)**                                    | **Below C2 Standard (Does Not Meet Expectations)**                                     |
| :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Completion & Depth of Argument**   | Addresses all aspects of the prompt with sophistication and insight. Presents a compelling case with a highly effective logical structure. Significant points are expertly highlighted. | Addresses most aspects of the prompt, but depth, sophistication, or logical structure may be less consistently effective. | Fails to address key aspects of the prompt; argument is superficial, unclear, or poorly structured. |
| **Coherence & Cohesion**                  | Text flows exceptionally smoothly with sophisticated and varied cohesive devices. Organization is highly effective and supports the argument seamlessly. | Text is coherent and well-organized, but flow or use of cohesive devices may occasionally be less sophisticated or varied. | Text lacks clear coherence or organization; connections between ideas are often weak or confusing. |
| **Vocabulary Range, Precision & Idiomacy**| Demonstrates a masterful command of a very wide and precise lexical repertoire, including sophisticated idiomatic expressions and nuanced language. | Uses a wide range of vocabulary accurately, but may lack the full precision, idiomaticity, or sophistication of C2. | Vocabulary is limited for complex argumentation, or frequent errors in word choice/idiom obscure meaning. |
| **Grammar Range, Accuracy & Flexibility** | Consistently demonstrates a full operational command of complex grammatical structures with precision and flexibility. Errors are negligible and do not affect communication. | Uses a wide range of complex structures with good accuracy, but may show occasional minor errors or less flexibility than typical of C2. | Limited range or control of complex grammatical structures; errors may sometimes impede understanding. |
| **Argumentation & Persuasiveness**        | Arguments are exceptionally well-developed, cogent, and persuasive, supported by insightful reasoning and/or evidence. Demonstrates superior critical thinking. | Arguments are well-developed and generally persuasive, but may lack the full depth or compelling force of C2. | Arguments are weak, poorly developed, or unconvincing. Lacks critical depth.           |
| **Style, Register & Tone**                | Consistently maintains an appropriate and sophisticated style, register, and tone, perfectly adapted to the task, audience, and purpose. Demonstrates stylistic finesse. | Style, register, and tone are appropriate and effective, but may lack the full sophistication or adaptability of C2. | Style, register, or tone are inappropriate or inconsistent, detracting from the message. |
| **Effectiveness in Highlighting Key Points**| Significant points are skilfully integrated and emphasized, ensuring the recipient notices and remembers them. | Key points are generally clear, but the emphasis or integration may be less effective than at C2. | Fails to effectively highlight or integrate key points.                                |
| **Length**                                | Approximately within the suggested word count.                                    | Significantly deviates from the suggested word count.                              | Grossly inappropriate length.                                                          |
