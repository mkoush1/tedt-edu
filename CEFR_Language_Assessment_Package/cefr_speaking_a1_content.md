# CEFR A1 Speaking Assessment Content

**Based on CEFR A1 Speaking Descriptors:**
*   **Spoken Interaction:** "I can interact in a simple way provided the other person is prepared to repeat or rephrase things at a slower rate of speech and help me formulate what I'm trying to say. I can ask and answer simple questions in areas of immediate need or on very familiar topics."
*   **Spoken Production:** "I can use simple phrases and sentences to describe where I live and people I know."

**Number of Tasks:** 3-4 (This is an initial draft for A1 Speaking. Tasks are designed for an examiner-candidate interaction or for text-based/recorded responses where applicable. Prompts will be simple and clear.)

**General Instructions for Examiner/System:** Speak slowly and clearly. Be prepared to repeat or rephrase. Provide support if the candidate struggles to formulate a response.

*This is a sample set. More tasks, or variations involving different familiar topics (e.g., daily routines, likes/dislikes, weather) and role-play scenarios (e.g., ordering a coffee) will be developed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the A1 Speaking descriptors. The interaction will always be supportive, with the examiner ready to assist.* 

**(Note on Implementation):** These tasks can be adapted for text-based responses if a live examiner is not available, though the interactional element is best assessed live or via recording. For text-based, prompts would be written, and candidates would type short responses.
