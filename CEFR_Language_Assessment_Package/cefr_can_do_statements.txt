UNDERST ANDING

Listening

I can recognise
familiar words and
very basic phrases
concerning myself,
my family and
immediate
concrete
surroundings when
people speak
slowly and clearly.

I can understand
phrases and the
highest frequency
vocabulary related to
areas of most
immediate personal
relevance (e.g. very
basic personal and
family information,
shopping, local area,
employment). I can
catch the main point
in short, clear, simple
messages and
announcements.

I can understand the
main points of clear
standard speech on
familiar matters regularly
encountered in work,
school, leisure, etc. I can
understand the main
point of many radio or
TV programmes on
current affairs or topics
of personal or
professional interest
when the delivery is
relatively slow and clear.

I can understand extended
speech and lectures and
follow even complex lines
of argument provided the
topic is reasonably familiar.
I can understand most TV
news and current affairs
programmes. I can
understand the majority of
films in standard dialect.

I can understand extended
speech even when it is not
clearly structured and
when relationships are
only implied and not
signaled explicitly. I can
understand television
programmes and films
without too much effort.

I have no difficulty in
understanding any kind of
spoken language, whether
live or broadcast, even when
delivered at fast native
speed, provided. I have
some time to get familiar
with the accent.

Reading

I can understand
familiar names,
words and very
simple sentences,
for example on
notices and posters
or in catalogues.

I can read very short,
simple texts. I can find
specific, predictable
information in simple
everyday material
such as
advertisements,
prospectuses, menus
and timetables and I
can understand short
simple personal
letters.

I can understand texts
that consist mainly of
high frequency everyday
or job-related language. I
can understand the
description of events,
feelings and wishes in
personal letters.

I can read articles and
reports concerned with
contemporary problems in
which the writers adopt
particular attitudes or
viewpoints. I can
understand contemporary
literary prose.

I can understand long and
complex factual and
literary texts, appreciating
distinctions of style. I can
understand specialised
articles and longer
technical instructions, even
when they do not relate to
my field.

I can read with ease virtually
all forms of the written
language, including abstract,
structurally or linguistically
complex texts such as
manuals, specialised articles
and literary works.

Spoken
Interaction

I can interact in a
simple way
provided the other
person is prepared
to repeat or
rephrase things at a
slower rate of
speech and help
me formulate what
I'm trying to say. I
can ask and answer
simple questions in
areas of immediate
need or on very
familiar topics.

I can communicate in
simple and routine
tasks requiring a
simple and direct
exchange of
information on
familiar topics and
activities. I can handle
very short social
exchanges, even
though I can't usually
understand enough to
keep the conversation
going myself.

I can deal with most
situations likely to arise
whilst travelling in an
area where the language
is spoken. I can enter
unprepared into
conversation on topics
that are familiar, of
personal interest or
pertinent to everyday
life (e.g. family, hobbies,
work, travel and current
events).

I can interact with a degree
of fluency and spontaneity
that makes regular
interaction with native
speakers quite possible. I
can take an active part in
discussion in familiar
contexts, accounting for
and sustaining my views.

I can express myself
fluently and spontaneously
without much obvious
searching for expressions. I
can use language flexibly
and effectively for social
and professional purposes.
I can formulate ideas and
opinions with precision
and relate my contribution
skillfully to those of other
speakers.

I can take part effortlessly in
any conversation or
discussion and have a good
familiarity with idiomatic
expressions and
colloquialisms. I can express
myself fluently and convey
finer shades of meaning
precisely. If I do have a
problem I can backtrack and
restructure around the
difficulty so smoothly that
other people are hardly
aware of it.
