*This is a sample set. More questions and varied simple audio inputs (e.g., very short, simple phone messages, basic instructions related to immediate environment) will be added to reach 10-15 items for A1 Listening. All audio will be designed to be spoken slowly and clearly, using high-frequency vocabulary and basic phrases, strictly aligning with A1 descriptors.* 

**(Note on Audio Files):** For actual implementation, each audio script will correspond to a separate audio file (e.g., `A1_Listening_1.1.mp3`, `A1_Listening_2.1.mp3`). These files are not created here but are implied by the scripts.
