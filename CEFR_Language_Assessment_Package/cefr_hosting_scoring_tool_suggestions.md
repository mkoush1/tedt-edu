# Suggested Free or Low-Code Hosting/Scoring Tools for CEFR Assessment

This document provides suggestions for free or low-code tools that can be used to host and facilitate the scoring of the CEFR-aligned language skills assessment, utilizing the provided `cefr_assessment_data.json` file.

Choosing the right tool depends on your technical comfort, the desired level of interactivity, and how you plan to administer the speaking and writing components.

## Option 1: Google Forms + Google Sheets (Free, No-Code/Low-Code)

Google Forms is a versatile free tool for creating quizzes and surveys. It can be adapted for many parts of this assessment.

*   **Suitability:**
    *   **Reading & Listening (MCQs):** Excellent. You can create multiple-choice questions, assign point values, and set correct answers for automatic scoring.
    *   **Writing:** Good for collecting text-based responses. You can create questions with long-answer text fields.
    *   **Listening Prompts:** You can link to externally hosted audio files (e.g., on Google Drive, YouTube, SoundCloud) in the question description.
    *   **Speaking Prompts:** You can provide prompts as text. Actual speaking responses would likely need to be handled separately (e.g., user records audio and emails it, or a live interview).
*   **How to Use with the JSON:**
    1.  **Manual Data Entry:** The most straightforward way is to manually create questions in Google Forms based on the content in `cefr_assessment_data.json` for each skill and level.
    2.  **Scripting (Low-Code):** Google Apps Script can be used to programmatically create Google Form questions from a Google Sheet. You would first need to convert relevant parts of the JSON data into a structured Google Sheet (e.g., question text, options, correct answer for MCQs; prompts for writing).
*   **Hosting:** Google Forms are hosted by Google.
*   **Scoring:**
    *   MCQs: Automatic scoring is a built-in feature.
    *   Writing/Speaking: Responses are collected in Google Forms/Sheets. Grading would be manual using the provided Markdown rubrics (you could link to the rubrics or copy parts into the form description).
*   **Pros:**
    *   Completely free and widely accessible.
    *   Easy to use interface for creating questions.
    *   Automatic scoring for MCQs.
    *   Responses are neatly collected in Google Sheets for review.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Less flexible UI compared to custom web pages.
    *   Integrating audio/video directly into the form flow can be clunky (usually involves links).
    *   Directly ingesting the entire JSON structure is not possible without significant scripting and data transformation.
    *   Speaking assessment is not directly supported for recording within the form.

## Option 2: GitHub Pages + Custom JavaScript (Free, Low-Code)

If you have some familiarity with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, GitHub Pages offers free static web hosting. This allows for a highly customizable assessment experience.

*   **Suitability:**
    *   **All Skills:** Provides maximum flexibility to render questions, prompts, embed audio/video, and create custom interactions for all skills.
*   **How to Use with the JSON:**
    1.  Host the `cefr_assessment_data.json` file along with your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in a GitHub repository.
    2.  Use JavaScript (as shown in the `cefr_embedding_instructions.md`) to fetch and parse the JSON data.
    3.  Dynamically generate HTML to display assessment content: questions, options, prompts, rubrics (using a Markdown library like `marked.js` for rubrics).
    4.  Implement logic for navigation, answer selection, and basic MCQ scoring.
*   **Hosting:** Free via GitHub Pages.
*   **Scoring:**
    *   MCQs: Can be auto-scored using JavaScript by comparing user selections to the `correct_answer` in the JSON.
    *   Writing/Speaking: The platform can display prompts and rubrics. Submissions could be via text areas (for writing). For speaking, users might need to use external recording tools and submit files, or you could integrate third-party recording APIs (more advanced).
*   **Pros:**
    *   Completely free and highly customizable.
    *   Direct use of the provided JSON structure.
    *   Full control over the user interface and experience.
    *   Can create a seamless experience with embedded audio/video.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires some web development knowledge (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
    *   Implementing features like user accounts, progress saving, or direct audio recording for speaking tasks would require more advanced JavaScript or integration with backend services (which might not be free).

## Option 3: Low-Code App Builders (e.g., Glide, Softr, Retool - Free Tiers Available)

Platforms like Glide (apps from Google Sheets), Softr (websites/apps from Airtable/Google Sheets), or Retool (internal tools) allow you to build applications with minimal coding, often using a spreadsheet as a database.

*   **Suitability:**
    *   Can be good for creating a structured interface for navigating levels and skills.
    *   Can display questions and collect answers.
*   **How to Use with the JSON:**
    1.  **Convert JSON to Spreadsheet:** You would first need to parse the `cefr_assessment_data.json` and import the relevant data into a Google Sheet or Airtable base. Each row could represent a question or a task.
    2.  **Connect Data Source:** Connect the app builder to your spreadsheet.
    3.  **Design Interface:** Use the platform's visual builder to design how questions are displayed and answers are collected.
*   **Hosting:** Typically hosted by the platform provider.
*   **Scoring:**
    *   MCQs: Some platforms might offer ways to check answers against a correct value in the spreadsheet.
    *   Writing/Speaking: Responses can be collected and displayed alongside rubric criteria (which could also be in the spreadsheet). Manual grading needed.
*   **Pros:**
    *   Faster development than custom coding for creating a structured app.
    *   Often have free tiers for small projects or limited users.
    *   Visually driven development.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Free tiers have limitations (e.g., data rows, users, branding, features).
    *   Flexibility might be constrained by the platform's capabilities.
    *   Directly using the nested JSON structure is usually not possible; data transformation is required.
    *   Advanced features like embedded audio recording might be limited or require paid plans/integrations.

## Recommendation:

*   **For ease of use and no-code MCQ/Writing collection:** Start with **Google Forms**. It's the quickest way to get parts of the assessment operational, especially for MCQs.
*   **For a comprehensive, customizable, and free solution (if comfortable with some coding):** **GitHub Pages + JavaScript** is the most powerful option for utilizing the full JSON structure and creating a tailored experience.
*   **For a more app-like interface with less coding than full web development:** Explore **Glide or Softr**, but be prepared to transform the JSON data into a flat spreadsheet structure and be mindful of free-tier limitations.

No single free, no-code tool will perfectly handle every aspect of this comprehensive assessment (especially interactive speaking tests and nuanced rubric application) without some compromises or manual workarounds. Consider a phased approach or combining tools if necessary.
