# CEFR C1 Speaking Assessment Content

**Based on CEFR C1 Speaking Descriptors:**
*   **Spoken Interaction:** "I can express myself fluently and spontaneously without much obvious searching for expressions. I can use language flexibly and effectively for social and professional purposes. I can formulate ideas and opinions with precision and relate my contribution skilfully to those of other speakers."
*   **Spoken Production:** "I can present clear, detailed descriptions of complex subjects integrating sub-themes, developing particular points and rounding off with an appropriate conclusion."

**Number of Tasks:** 3-4 (This is an initial draft for C1 Speaking. Tasks are designed for examiner-candidate interaction or for text-based/recorded responses. Prompts will encourage fluent, spontaneous, precise, and well-structured responses on complex subjects.)

**General Instructions for Examiner/System:** Expect fluent and spontaneous speech. Engage in natural conversation, allowing the candidate to take the lead in developing ideas. Challenge or probe opinions respectfully to assess precision and argumentation skills.

## Task 1: Extended Discussion on a Complex or Abstract Topic (Interaction & Production)

**Examiner/Prompt:** "Let's delve into the concept of ‘work-life balance’ in the modern world. It’s a term we hear a lot, but its meaning and achievability can vary greatly. From your perspective, what are the key challenges in achieving a healthy work-life balance today, and what strategies, either individual or societal, do you think are most effective in addressing these challenges? Feel free to draw on your own experiences or observations."

**(Expected Candidate Response Type):** A fluent, well-structured, and detailed response, expressing nuanced opinions, formulating ideas with precision, and potentially integrating sub-themes. e.g., "That’s a very pertinent topic. I believe the primary challenge to achieving work-life balance in contemporary society stems from a confluence of factors. Firstly, the pervasiveness of technology often blurs the lines between professional and personal life... Secondly, there's an ingrained cultural glorification of ‘busyness’... In terms of strategies, on an individual level, setting firm boundaries is crucial... Societally, I think companies need to foster a culture that genuinely values employee well-being... Furthermore, policy interventions like flexible working arrangements or even exploring ideas like a four-day work week could be transformative..."

**(Follow-up prompts by examiner to facilitate deeper discussion):**
*   "You mentioned the role of technology. How do you see AI and automation potentially reshaping this balance in the future?"
*   "Some argue that the pursuit of work-life balance is a luxury not afforded to everyone. What are your thoughts on the socio-economic dimensions of this issue?"
*   "How do cultural differences influence perceptions and practices related to work-life balance?"

**(Scoring Rubric Focus for C1 Task 1):**
*   **Task Completion:** Engages fluently and spontaneously in a discussion on a complex topic, expressing ideas and opinions with precision.
*   **Fluency and Spontaneity:** Speaks fluently with little obvious searching for expressions. Can use language flexibly.
*   **Coherence and Cohesion:** Presents clear, well-structured arguments, integrating sub-themes and developing particular points effectively. Uses a wide range of cohesive devices skilfully.
*   **Vocabulary Range and Precision:** Uses a broad lexical repertoire including idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms. Shows good command of sophisticated vocabulary and can convey finer shades of meaning precisely.
*   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:** Consistently maintains a high degree of grammatical accuracy; errors are rare and difficult to spot. Uses a wide range of complex grammatical structures flexibly and effectively.
*   **Interaction:** Relates contributions skilfully to those of the other speaker (examiner). Can take the initiative and guide the discussion.

## Task 2: Presentation on a Complex Subject (Production)

**Examiner/Prompt:** "I would like you to prepare a short presentation (about 2-3 minutes) on one of the following complex subjects. You will have 2 minutes to prepare and make some notes.

1.  The ethical considerations of artificial intelligence in decision-making processes (e.g., in healthcare, justice, or finance).
2.  The role of education in fostering global citizenship and addressing global challenges.
3.  The impact of globalization on local cultures and traditions."

**(Candidate has 2 minutes to prepare, then delivers a 2-3 minute presentation.)**

**(Expected Candidate Response Type - for topic 1, for example):** A clear, detailed, and well-structured presentation. e.g., "Good morning. Today, I want to explore the intricate ethical considerations surrounding the increasing use of artificial intelligence in critical decision-making processes... One of the foremost concerns is algorithmic bias... Another significant ethical dilemma revolves around accountability and transparency... Furthermore, the potential for AI to devalue human judgment and intuition in fields like healthcare or justice is a profound issue... In conclusion, while AI offers immense potential, navigating its integration into decision-making requires robust ethical frameworks, ongoing public discourse, and a commitment to human oversight..."

**(Follow-up questions by examiner after the presentation):**
*   "That was very insightful. Could you elaborate on what you mean by 'algorithmic bias' in this context?"
*   "What specific measures do you think could be implemented to ensure accountability when AI makes an error in a critical decision?"

**(Scoring Rubric Focus for C1 Task 2):**
*   **Task Completion:** Presents a clear, detailed description/argument on a complex subject.
*   **Content and Development:** Integrates sub-themes, develops particular points in detail, and rounds off with an appropriate conclusion.
*   **Organization and Structure:** Presentation is logically structured and easy to follow.
*   **Vocabulary Range and Precision:** Uses a wide range of vocabulary accurately and appropriately to discuss complex and abstract concepts.
*   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy:** Uses a variety of complex grammatical structures effectively and with a high degree of accuracy.
*   **Fluency and Delivery:** Speaks fluently and confidently, with natural intonation and pacing.
*   **Pronunciation:** Clear and natural pronunciation.

## Task 3: Handling an Unpredictable Situation or Argument (Interaction)

**Examiner/Prompt:** "Let’s imagine a scenario. You are part of a community group that has received funding to create a new public space in your neighbourhood. There are two main proposals: one is to create a modern, minimalist garden with sculptures and seating areas, and the other is to create a vibrant community vegetable garden where residents can grow their own food. I will take the role of a strong advocate for the minimalist sculpture garden, and I’d like you to argue for the community vegetable garden. Try to persuade me, addressing my potential counter-arguments (e.g., aesthetics, maintenance, appeal to a wider range of people)."

**(Examiner initiates by strongly advocating for the sculpture garden, e.g., "I firmly believe the sculpture garden would be a far more sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing addition to our neighbourhood, offering a tranquil space for reflection. A vegetable garden could become messy and require a lot of ongoing work from residents who might lose interest.")**

**(Expected Candidate Response Type):** Engages in a debate, skilfully relating their contributions, formulating precise arguments, and handling counter-arguments effectively. e.g., "I understand your points about aesthetics and tranquility, and a sculpture garden certainly has its merits. However, I believe a community vegetable garden offers a different, perhaps more dynamic, set of benefits. For instance, it fosters community interaction and collaboration in a very practical way... Regarding maintenance, while it does require commitment, it also offers educational opportunities... Moreover, the appeal of fresh, locally grown produce is undeniable and promotes healthier lifestyles... Perhaps we could even integrate some aesthetic elements into the vegetable garden design..."

**(Scoring Rubric Focus for C1 Task 3):**
*   **Task Completion:** Effectively participates in a discussion/debate, formulating ideas and opinions with precision and relating contributions skilfully.
*   **Argumentation and Persuasion:** Can construct and sustain a coherent argument, address counter-arguments, and use persuasive language.
*   **Flexibility and Spontaneity:** Adapts language and arguments effectively in response to the other speaker.
*   **Vocabulary and Grammar:** Uses a wide and precise range of vocabulary and grammatical structures appropriate for argumentation and formal discussion.
*   **Interactional Fluency:** Manages the interaction fluently, taking turns appropriately and maintaining the flow of discussion.
*   **Appropriacy:** Maintains an appropriate tone and level of formality for a debate or persuasive discussion.

*This is a sample set. More tasks, or variations involving different complex/abstract topics, professional scenarios (e.g., chairing a meeting, negotiating a complex deal), or debates on nuanced issues will be developed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the C1 Speaking descriptors. The focus is on fluent, spontaneous, flexible, and effective communication for social and professional purposes.* 

**(Note on Implementation):** These tasks require live interaction or high-fidelity recorded responses to accurately assess the full range of C1 speaking skills.
