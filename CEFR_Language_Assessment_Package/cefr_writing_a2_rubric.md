# CEFR A2 Writing Assessment - Grading Rubric

**Based on CEFR A2 Writing Descriptor:** "I can write short, simple notes and messages relating to matters in areas of immediate need. I can write a very simple personal letter, for example thanking someone for something."

**General Notes for Grading A2 Writing:**
*   Focus is on conveying simple information in familiar contexts. Control of basic grammar and vocabulary is expected, but errors that do not impede understanding are tolerated.
*   Ability to link simple ideas is emerging.

## Task 1: Writing a Short Note (Immediate Need, e.g., to a flatmate)

(Approx. 25-35 words)

| Criteria                     | **Achieves A2 Standard (Meets Expectations)**                                     | **Approaching A2 Standard (Needs Improvement)**                                    | **Below A2 Standard (Does Not Meet Expectations)**                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Completion**          | Main message (e.g., late home due to study group) is clearly conveyed.            | Main message is partially conveyed or somewhat unclear.                            | Main message is not conveyed or is incomprehensible.                                   |
| **Communicative Purpose**    | Note is understandable for its intended purpose (informing flatmate).             | Purpose of the note is not entirely clear; flatmate might be confused.             | Note fails to achieve its communicative purpose.                                       |
| **Vocabulary**               | Uses simple vocabulary related to daily routines, reasons, and social messages.   | Limited vocabulary; may use inappropriate words or struggle to express the idea.     | Vocabulary is inadequate; meaning is obscured.                                         |
| **Grammar & Structure**      | Uses simple sentence structures (e.g., "I will be late because..."). Basic control of present/future tenses, prepositions. | Attempts simple sentences but with frequent errors that sometimes obscure meaning.   | Lacks basic sentence structure; errors make the message largely incomprehensible.      |
| **Cohesion (Basic)**         | Simple linking of ideas (e.g., using "because", "so").                         | Little or no attempt to link ideas; sentences are very disjointed.                 | No evidence of cohesion; text is a collection of unrelated phrases or words.         |
| **Length & Appropriacy**     | Approximately within suggested word count. Tone is appropriate for a short note.  | Significantly too short/long, or tone is inappropriate.                            | Grossly inappropriate length or tone.                                                  |

## Task 2: Writing a Short Message (Arrangement, e.g., to a friend)

(Approx. 30-40 words)

| Criteria                     | **Achieves A2 Standard (Meets Expectations)**                                     | **Approaching A2 Standard (Needs Improvement)**                                    | **Below A2 Standard (Does Not Meet Expectations)**                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Completion**          | Message invites friend, suggests time/activity, and asks about availability.      | One or more key elements of the task are missing (e.g., no suggestion of time).    | Fails to address the task requirements; no clear invitation or arrangement.          |
| **Communicative Purpose**    | Invitation/arrangement is clear and understandable.                               | Invitation/arrangement is somewhat unclear or ambiguous.                           | Purpose of the message is not clear; fails to function as an invitation.             |
| **Vocabulary**               | Uses vocabulary for making arrangements, days, times, leisure activities.         | Limited vocabulary for arrangements; may rely on very basic words.                 | Vocabulary is insufficient to make arrangements.                                       |
| **Grammar & Structure**      | Uses simple questions and statements. Appropriate use of tenses for future.       | Errors in question formation or tense use may make the message hard to understand. | Grammatical errors are so frequent that the message is largely incomprehensible.      |
| **Appropriacy**              | Tone is suitable for a short message to a friend.                                 | Tone may be slightly inappropriate (e.g., too formal/informal).                    | Tone is clearly inappropriate for the context.                                         |

## Task 3: Writing a Very Simple Personal Letter (Thanking)

(Approx. 40-50 words)

| Criteria                     | **Achieves A2 Standard (Meets Expectations)**                                     | **Approaching A2 Standard (Needs Improvement)**                                    | **Below A2 Standard (Does Not Meet Expectations)**                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task Completion**          | Letter thanks recipient, mentions the present, and says why it is liked.          | One or more key elements are missing (e.g., doesnâ€™t say why present is liked).   | Fails to address the task; no clear expression of thanks or mention of present.      |
| **Communicative Purpose**    | Gratitude is clearly expressed and understood.                                    | Expression of gratitude is weak or unclear.                                        | Fails to convey gratitude effectively.                                                 |
| **Vocabulary**               | Uses vocabulary for expressing thanks, describing objects, giving simple reasons. | Limited vocabulary for these functions; expression may be repetitive or basic.     | Vocabulary is inadequate to express thanks or describe the present.                    |
| **Grammar & Structure**      | Uses simple past and present tenses. Basic sentence connectors (and, because).    | Frequent errors in tenses or connectors that may obscure meaning.                  | Grammatical control is very weak; message is largely incomprehensible.                 |
| **Structure (Basic Letter)** | Basic letter format (greeting, body, closing) is generally followed.              | Some elements of letter format may be missing or incorrectly used.                 | No recognizable letter format.                                                         |
